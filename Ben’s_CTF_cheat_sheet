I've been going through the learning paths on TryHackMe.com. This is what I have learned from this experience. The majority of CTFs are based on web servers. This makes sense because web servers are accessible from an internet connection, this makes them more vulnerable to attacks.
 
The majority of CTFs are going to start with an NMAP scan. This allows you to see the attack surface of a system with open ports, services, and service versions. In order to interact with other devices, ports are opened to run services as either the client or server. 
 
NMAP - scans for open ports and services 
 
#quick nmap 
cmd: nmap -Pn -T5 [IP] 
 
#basic nmap 
cmd: nmap -v -sC -sV [IP] 
 
#through nmap 
cmd: nmap -A -T4 -p- [IP]  
 
#nmap vulnerability 
cmd: nmap -sV -vv - - script vuln [IP] 
 
#more common for Windows 
cmd: nmap -sV -vv --script vuln [IP]  
 
#more specific after finding open ports 
cmd: nmap -T4 -A -sC -sV --script=vuln -p22,80,3306 10.10.156.87  
 
#scanning for script FTP 
cmd: nmap -p 111 --script=nfs-ls,nfs-statfs,nfs-showmount MACHINE_IP 
 
#SMB vuln 
cmd: nmap -p 445 --script=smb-enum-shares.nse,smb-enum-users.nse $I
 
Since most CTFs are web servers, once you have the IP address, try putting the IP address in the web browser. Also try starting a gobuster scan:

Port 80
#Check web source code
#Run gobuster scan to find hidden web directories
cmd: gobuster dir -u http://[IP] -w [wordlist path] -x php,sh,txt,cgi,html,js,css,py -t 200 --no-errors

Common Directories
robots.txt
uploads
admin
administrator
config

#dirsearch: gobuster alternate - scans hidden web directories
cmd: dirsearch -u $IP -e php,html,txt,aspx,css -w /opt/dir -t 50 -r

#Vuln scan with Nikto
cmd: nikto -h “http://[IP]”

Get Source Code in terminal
curl - pulls page source
 
Port 21: FTP
Port 22: SSH
Port 139 or 445: SMB

To be continued...
